        "answer": "Generally, we react within 1–4 hours, in urgent cases even immediately. For our subscription partners, we provide guaranteed response times."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you undertake on-site visits or only provide remote support?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you create websites completely from scratch?",
        "answer": "Naturally. We develop unique, responsive websites with modern technologies (Next.js, React, Tailwind), and ensure the site is fast, secure, and search engine optimized."

        "question": "What is CRM Pro and how does it help my business?",

        "question": "What security measures do you apply?",
        "answer": "We use modern firewalls, data backup solutions, encryption, and access management. We design all our systems to be GDPR-compliant, so data security is default."

        "question": "In what form can we contract with you?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How much does website or system development cost?",
        "answer": "Basic websites start from 250,000 HUF, while the price of unique systems or CRM solutions is determined depending on functionality. We give a precise price quote before every project."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it worth choosing cloud-based solutions?",
        "answer": "The cloud is fast, secure, and flexible – no need to maintain your own server, data is always available, and expansion can be solved in moments."
