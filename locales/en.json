        "question": "How is SIRONIC different from other IT providers?",
        "answer": "We are not just 'fixers' – we proactively monitor systems, prevent problems, and communicate in human language. We don't let IT be an obstacle, but rather forge a competitive advantage from it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast do you react to an error report?",
        "answer": "Generally, we react within 1–4 hours, in urgent cases even immediately. For our subscription partners, we provide guaranteed response times."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you undertake on-site visits or only provide remote support?",
        "answer": "Yes, both! We resolve most errors remotely, but if necessary, we also go to the site personally."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you create websites completely from scratch?",
        "answer": "Naturally. We develop unique, responsive websites with modern technologies (Next.js, React, Tailwind), and ensure the site is fast, secure, and search engine optimized."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is CRM Pro and how does it help my business?",
        "answer": "CRM Pro is a custom-developed customer management system that makes sales processes transparent, automates administration, and can be integrated with existing systems. Available in a price range accessible to smaller companies too."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security measures do you apply?",
        "answer": "We use modern firewalls, data backup solutions, encryption, and access management. We design all our systems to be GDPR-compliant, so data security is default."

      {
        "question": "In what form can we contract with you?",
        "answer": "We work in two main constructions: ad-hoc assignment (for occasional tasks) and monthly maintenance contract (permanent operation and support). Both are transparent, with fixed pricing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does website or system development cost?",
        "answer": "Basic websites start from 250,000 HUF, while the price of unique systems or CRM solutions is determined depending on functionality. We give a precise price quote before every project."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is it worth choosing cloud-based solutions?",
        "answer": "The cloud is fast, secure, and flexible – no need to maintain your own server, data is always available, and expansion can be solved in moments."
