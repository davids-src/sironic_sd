# Backlink Strategy for SIRONIC

## Overview
Building a strong backlink profile is crucial for improving Domain Authority (DA) and search engine rankings. Since SIRONIC is a B2B IT service provider, the focus should be on high-quality, relevant links rather than quantity.

## 1. Local Directories & Citations (High Priority)
Ensure SIRONIC is listed in reputable local and national business directories. This confirms legitimacy and improves local SEO.
- **Google Business Profile**: Ensure it's fully optimized and linked.
- **Aranyoldalak.hu**: Standard Hungarian business directory.
- **Cegjegyzek.hu**: Official company registry.
- **Europages**: For international reach (DE, SK, RO).
- **Clutch.co / GoodFirms**: Create profiles for IT service providers.

## 2. Partner & Client Links
- **Client Testimonials**: Ask satisfied clients if they can feature SIRONIC as a partner on their website (e.g., in their footer or "Partners" section).
- **Technology Partners**: If you are a reseller or certified partner for any software/hardware (e.g., Microsoft, Dell, ESET), ensure you are listed on their "Find a Partner" pages.

## 3. Content Marketing & Guest Posting
- **Tech Blogs (Hungarian & Regional)**: Write guest posts about IT security, system administration, or digital transformation for relevant tech blogs (e.g., HWSW, IT Business).
- **Local News Portals**: Publish PR articles about local IT developments in Székesfehérvár (e.g., fmc.hu, feol.hu).
- **LinkedIn Articles**: Publish high-quality articles on LinkedIn and link back to the blog on sironic.hu.

## 4. Sponsorships & Events
- **Local Events**: Sponsor local business meetups or tech events in Székesfehérvár.
- **University/School Partnerships**: Partner with local educational institutions (e.g., Óbudai Egyetem Alba Regia Kar) for internships or guest lectures, often resulting in a .edu (or .hu equivalent) backlink.

## 5. Social Signals
- Ensure all social media profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram) link back to the website.
- Share every blog post and case study on social media to generate traffic and potential shares.

## Action Plan
1.  **Audit**: List all current backlinks (use Google Search Console).
2.  **Outreach**: Contact 3-5 current clients this month for a backlink.
3.  **Register**: Submit to 5 high-quality directories per month.
4.  **Create**: Write one guest post or PR article per quarter.
